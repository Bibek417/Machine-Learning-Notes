## Introduction

There are 3 types of machine learning:


### 1. Regression
In regression, the output variable (or the variable we want to predict) is continuous.  
Examples include predicting a student's subject score and house price prediction.

### 2. Classification
In classification, the output variable (or the variable we want to predict) is categorical. This predicted variable is also known as a "label."  
Examples include: classifying emails as spam or not spam and predicting True/False, or 0/1 outcomes.

### 3. Clustering
In clustering, we don't have labels, meaning there is no target variable. As the name suggests, we create groups or clusters based on similarities.  
Example: customer segmentation.

### Difference Between Clustering and Classification
In both classification and clustering, we deal with categorical variables. The key difference is that in classification, we have a label, while in clustering, we do not.
