# Machine-Learning-Notes
## Introduction 
- 3 type of machine learning are there 
1. Regression
2. Classification
3. Clustering
- Regression - Here the output variable or the veriable which we want to predict is a contineous variable. examples  - the score of a student on a subject, House Price Prediction.
- Classification - here The output variable or the veriable which we want to predict is a categorical veriable, we also called thatpredicted veriable as lebel. Example - classifying  emails as spam or ham, True/false, 0/1 etc.
- Clustering - Here we dont have the lebel or we can say our terget veriable is not there, in clustering as name suggest we make groups/clusters based on similarities. example - customer segmentation.

- Difference Between Clustering and Classification
- in both we talk about categorical variable but the main difference is in classification we have lebel but dont have lebel in clustering.
